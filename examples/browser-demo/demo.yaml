      # Browser Step Demo

      This demo shows how browser steps work with automatic
      screenshot capture during recording.

      **Features demonstrated:**
      - Browser step navigation
      - Automatic screenshot capture
      - Variable substitution in URLs

  - rest: GET /users/1

    save:
      userId: id
      userName: name
      userEmail: email

  - slide: |
      # User Retrieved

      We fetched user data from the API:

      - **Name:** $userName
      - **Email:** $userEmail
      - **ID:** $userId

      Now let's view this user in the browser...

  - browser: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/$userId

      # Screenshot Captured!

      When you run `demoscript record`, the browser step
      automatically captures a screenshot of the page.

      The screenshot is saved to:
      ```
      assets/screenshots/step-<n>.png
      ```

  - rest: GET /posts?userId=$userId

    save:
      postCount: _length
      firstPostTitle: "[0].title"

  - slide: |
      # User Posts

      Found **$postCount** posts by $userName.

      First post: *"$firstPostTitle"*

  - browser: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts?userId=$userId
